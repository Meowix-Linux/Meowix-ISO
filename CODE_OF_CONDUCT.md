Let it be known that this open source and/or free software project (hereinafter referred to as "the Project") has no self-imposed code of conduct or guidelines as to how its contributors should behave. However, contributors to the Project should nevertheless follow any code of conduct, community guidelines, rules, or regulations imposed by the source code host (hereinafter referred to as "the Host"). If the Project so chooses to later implement their own code of conduct or guidelines, they may do so, thus abandoning this document, the AntiCoC, as long as it does not conflict with any guidelines that may be imposed by the Host.
